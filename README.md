# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis
In this project we predict sentiment of a statement based on the sentiment labeled sample tweets from Twitter. The project uses Scikit-Learn and NLTK for Python and applies multiple learning modules including RNN, KNN, SVM and Naive Bayes. The accuracy of the prediction can be above 75%.
